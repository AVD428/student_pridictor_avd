Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various features such as socioeconomic status, parental education, study time, etc. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically using the Random Forest Regressor. The dataset used contains information about students' demographics and academic records, and the model predicts their final grade based on these inputs.

Objectives
Understand the relationship between different factors and students' final grades.
Build a machine learning model to predict the final grade of students.
Evaluate the model based on performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
Visualize important features and performance metrics.
Features of the Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Socioeconomic status: A categorical feature representing the socioeconomic status of the student.
Parental education: A categorical feature representing the education level of the student's parents.
Study time: A numerical feature indicating the amount of time the student spends on studying.
Absences: The number of days the student was absent from school.
Final Grade: The target variable representing the student's final grade.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Used for numerical operations.
scikit-learn: Provides tools for model building, evaluation, and splitting the dataset.
matplotlib: Used for data visualization.
openpyxl: Used for reading Excel files in Python.
Random Forest Regressor: The machine learning algorithm used for prediction.
How to Run the Code
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib openpyxl
Step 2: Upload the Dataset
Before running the code, make sure to upload the dataset (student_data.xlsx) into your environment. If you're using Google Colab, you can upload the file as follows:

python
Copy
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload the file through Colab's interface
Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data
The code will automatically load and preprocess the data, filling missing values and encoding categorical columns like "Socioeconomic status" and "Parental education".

Step 4: Run the Model
To train and evaluate the model, simply call the train_and_evaluate_model() function with the path to your dataset:

python
Copy
train_and_evaluate_model('student_data.xlsx')
This will split the data into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest Regressor model, and then evaluate the model using performance metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².

Step 5: Review the Output
The model will output the following evaluation metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
It will also generate visualizations:

Actual vs Predicted Final Grades
Feature Importance Plot
Code Explanation
1. Data Preprocessing:
The load_and_preprocess_data() function handles missing values and encodes categorical columns.
Numerical columns have missing values filled with their median.
Categorical columns (such as Socioeconomic status and Parental education) have missing values filled with their most frequent value (mode).
Label encoding is used to convert categorical values into numerical values.
2. Model Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Random Forest Regressor is used to train the model.
Model performance is evaluated based on various metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²).
The model's predictions are compared to actual values with a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted grades.
Feature importance is displayed to show which features have the most influence on predicting student grades.
Sample Output
Upon successful execution, the following results will be printed:

Copy
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.412
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.207
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.455
R-squared (R2): 0.85
Visualizations:
Actual vs Predicted Grades: A scatter plot showing the actual vs. predicted final grades.
Feature Importance: A bar chart displaying the importance of various features in predicting the final grade.

Additional Notes
Make sure the dataset (student_data.xlsx) is in the same directory or correctly referenced in the file path.
You can modify the model to use other algorithms like Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting for comparison.
